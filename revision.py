# for i in range(10):
#     for j in range(5):
#         print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
#         print(i, j)
# Given two lists of words, 
# use nested for loops to 
# generate and print all 
# possible pairs, one word 
# from each list. For example,
# pairing ["apple", "banana"] with ["red", "yellow"] should print apple-red, apple-yellow, etc.
